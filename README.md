# Work Day Scheduler

## About this Planner

 * Planner shows the current day and a time block for each hour in the normal 9-5 work day

 * The time block for each hour shows a different color based on whether it is past present or future

 * When a time block is clicked, the text can be edited

 * When the save button for the time block is clicked the text in the time block is saved

 * The added text is stored in local storage and persists between page reloads

 * The text block background colors and the current day given are set to readjust periodically to change even if the page is not reloaded each hour or each day

## Resources Used

 * moment.js to get the current day and current moment to set the day and background colors

 * bootstrap to set up the rows for the timeblocks

 * jquery to simplify some of the functions to change the text on the page

 * JSON to help store the data in local storage and load it back from local storage
